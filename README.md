- 👋 Hi, I’m @David123552
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer. I have been doing it for years but it is something that I have been wanting to do as a profession since I was a kid.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create AI in Unreal Engine (Blueprints/C++), and ASP.NET/webforms
- 💞️ I am not currently looking to collaborate, but if something came up to be a good focus for furthering my skills, I will always be open to the prospect.
- 📫 How to reach me - Email is davidwilkinson123552@gmail.com - I will likely make a seperate email just for Github/more professional means. 

My proficiencies lie in C# and Java, but I learn fast as long as I understand what I am learning about.
